Program Summary:

The long term goal of this program will be to have a sci-fi RPG 2D platformer game that will have a fully fledged story, gear system, map design etc. Its uniqueness comes from the fact that the enemy will be both an AI in the game design and the story. The AI will be sort of a genetic algorithm that based on the playstyle of the player, will make it harder in certain aspects and easier in others. This is designed to not enable one style of play and to give the player the requirement to change their playstyle up.


Topics:
- CLass
- Enums
- structs
- overloaded operators


There are not any known bugs currently at the time of submission

In the next module, I want to try and further the developement of the genetic algorithm and get a live user input and graphic interface to pop up

I would honestly say that I should get around a 92-94 on this project...
- I have an overloaded operator but I did not fully implement it into the code and test it (-3)
- And I started working on this well over a week ago but I did not remember to push them to my github, as I normally do that when I need to pull changes on my laptop but I was exclusively working on this from my desktop for this one.






PROGRAM UPDATE FOR MODULE 2 BELOW (OEPM2):
    -Alright so this time we are gonig to add some friendly inheritance to our weapon and mapdisplay classes.
    -An inventory 'has a' weapon
    -I also want to try and get a gui to start working for me and maybe a single map....
