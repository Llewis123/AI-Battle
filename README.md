# AI-Battle!

- Greetings! This repository is dedicated to my experimental game that I've been developing.
- The game is primarily coded in C++ using the SDL framework graphics library.

## Overview

The long-term goal of this project is to create a sci-fi RPG 2D platformer game with a fully-fledged story, gear system, map design, and more. What makes it unique is the integration of AI not only in the game design but also in the narrative.

## AI Implementation

The enemy in the game is powered by a genetic algorithm. It adapts to the player's playstyle, making certain aspects of the game harder while easing others. This approach is intended to prevent a single dominant playstyle and encourages players to adapt and evolve their strategies. Below is a table of exampels of how different types of inputs will be registered and taken into account by the algorithm.
